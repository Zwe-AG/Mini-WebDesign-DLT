            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tokyo, formerly (until 1868) Edo, city and capital of Tokyo to (metropolis) and of Japan.
                It is located at the head of Tokyo Bay on the Pacific coast of central Honshu. It is the focus of
                the vast metropolitan area often called Greater Tokyo, the largest urban and industrial agglomeration in Japan.
                Special wards are a special form of municipalities in Japan under the 1947 Local Autonomy Law. 
                They are city-level wards: primary subdivisions of a prefecture with municipal autonomy largely 
                comparable to other forms of municipalities.

            <p>The history of the temple goes that all the way back to 628, when legends says two brothers pulled a statue of Kannon fromthe Sumidagawa River
                while fishing. Despite trying to return it to the river, the statue always came back to them. They tookthe hint, and in 645 Sensoji was built
                to honor the goddess and house this sacred statue.</p>
